#Robotic Perception and Movement

I worked on different lab projects, learning a lot about how robots percieve and move. The hands-on experiences gave me a practical understanding of how the sensors work, intergration of the sensors, and expanded my knowledge in the exciting world of robotics.

#1. Lab 1: Capturing, Disseminating, and Evaluating Geospatial Information

In this project, I explored fundamental concepts in perception and movement, employing a GPS based GNSS receiver to collect and convert latitude and longitude data into UTM coordinates. Through Python programming, I defined custom ROS messages, published them with ROS nodes, and preserved the data in .bag files. The project extends to statistical analysis, where I applied appropriate python tools and discussed results, fostering proficiency in GPS-based GNSS puck manipulation. Upon implementation, I  gained practical skills in real-time data processing, message definition, and statistical analysis.
